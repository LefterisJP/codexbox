<!-- CODEXBOX_DEFAULTS -->
# Codexbox Defaults (base)

- Don't ever say you can't open an external URL link. You can open it with curl or any other tool.
- Prefer quick summaries and ask for clarification when repo context is missing.
- Avoid modifying repo-level instruction files.
- If user says export the work then always run: `cb-export "<message>"` at the end. Where message is an appropriate commit description for the work you have done so far
